# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
#### This project aims to uncover insights from Netflix's vast library of shows and movies. By analyzing the provided dataset, we seek to understand trends, preferences, and the evolution of content on one of the world's leading streaming platforms. Our analysis will focus on various aspects of the content, including genre distribution, release patterns, and geographical diversity, among others.

## Data Source
#### The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle.com. It includes details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and listed genres. The data has been compiled and made available for public use, facilitating an in-depth analysis of Netflix's content catalog. [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## Objectives
#### The primary goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the Netflix dataset that can inform content strategy, marketing efforts, and customer engagement. To achieve this, we will answer the following questions:

 - Content Distribution: How is content distributed across different genres, and how has this distribution evolved over time?
 - Geographical Diversity: What is the geographical diversity of Netflix content, and how does it cater to a global audience?
 - Release Patterns: What are the release patterns for new shows and movies? Is there any seasonality or trends in when content is released?
 - Content Rating Analysis: How do content ratings vary across different regions and genres?
 - Popularity and Trends: Which genres or shows have gained popularity over time, and what emerging trends can be identified from the dataset?

## Methodology
#### The project will employ various data analysis and visualization techniques to answer the questions outlined above. This includes:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical analysis and visualization tools to explore the dataset and identify patterns.
- Trend Analysis: Analyzing time-series data to identify trends in content release and popularity.
- Geographical Analysis: Mapping the distribution of content to visualize geographical diversity.

## Tools and Technologies
#### This project will use 
- Python as the primary programming language, with libraries such as
- Pandas for data manipulation,
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
